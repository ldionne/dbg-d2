TODO
----

- thread ID in throw log, asserts, notes, etc

- python script to generate assert header for other libraries that optionally use DBG_... macros

- ability to generate core dumps on demand (and continue execution) where possible.

- cyclic lock-free micro-log.

- investigate _set_invalid_parameter_handler() and _set_purecall_handler() for Visual C++

- investigate structured exception handling and signal handling to ensure core-dump generation.


BUGS
----

- There's quite often an extra frame in call stacks in OS X gcc configurations.
  - Find proper way of deducing bad program counter, rather than current workaround.
